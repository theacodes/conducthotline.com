# About ConductHotline.com

I created ConductHotline.com to make it easier for event attendees to *report* issues and event organizers to *respond*.


## Why this is important

A [Code of Conduct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_conduct) makes it clear what behaviors are acceptable in your community. These things are often applied to software projects but are increasingly being applied to meetups, conferences, and other in-person events. This is a **good** thing, however, having an email to report conduct violations is woefully inadequate in a setting where *seconds matter*.


## How this helps

This website is a *hosted, multi-tenant* Code of Conduct "Hotline". It gives event organizers the ability to create a designed phone number that attendees can call to report issues. If called, this number starts a conference call with all of the event's conduct committee members. If texted, it starts a group chat with those people instead. It provides a way for attendees to get immediate assistance if they run into issues.


## I have an event, how do I use this?

It's invitation-only right now. Please email me, Thea Flowers, at me@thea.codes. I'm happy to chat about your event and get you set up.


## Who pays for this?

[Thea Flowers](https://thea.codes) (me). I offer this as a free service to any events that want to use it. It's not expensive, but it's also not free, either. If you want you can [donate](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=E9R6P8RVSRHSS&currency_code=USD&source=url).
